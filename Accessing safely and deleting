#Part 1
# Closing price for day before
day_before_closing_price_date = closing_price_date - timedelta(days=1)

# Safely print closing price day before or None if it's missing
print(alphabet_hist.get(day_before_closing_price_date))

#Part 2:
# Get day eight weeks in future
future_closing_price_date = closing_price_date + timedelta(weeks=8)

# Safely get value for the future date or get string 'Missing' if the date is missing
print(alphabet_hist.get(future_closing_price_date, 'Missing'))

#Part 3
# Print with key
print(alphabet_hist)

# Remove entry
del(alphabet_hist[closing_price_date])
# Print with key deleted
